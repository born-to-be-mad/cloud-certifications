.A retailer wants to group together online shoppers that have similar attributes to enable its marketing team to create targeted marketing campaigns for new product launches. +
Which type of machine learning is this?
Select only one answer.

.. classification
.. clustering
.. multiclass classification

+
.Answer
[example%collapsible]
**clustering** +
Clustering is a machine learning type that analyzes unlabeled data to find similarities present in the data. It then groups (clusters) similar data together. In this example, the company can group online customers based on attributes that include demographic data and shopping behaviors. The company can then recommend new products to those groups of customers who are most likely to be interested in them. Classification and multiclass classification are used to predict categories of data. Regression is a machine learning scenario that is used to predict numeric values.
